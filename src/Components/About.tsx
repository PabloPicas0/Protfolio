        Hi, I'm Paweł, a self-taught programmer from Poland. One day I decided to switch career from being
        waiter/barman. What I didn't know back then is that in the process of learning to code I would soon
        discover a true passion.
      </p>

      <p className="about-content">
        I have experience developing web applications, building websites and actively contributing to Open
        Source projects. My world revolves around React - that's the technology I know best and work daily
        with.
